## Typical Data Manipulation Functions

| Function    | Returns                                            |
|-------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| `query`    | keep rows that satisfy conditions                  |
| `assign`    | apply a transformation to existing [split] columns |
| `['col1', 'col2']`| select and keep columns with matching names    |
| `merge`| merge columns from separate tables into one table  |
| `groupby`  | split data into groups by an existing factor       |
| `agg` | summarize across rows to use after groupby [and combine split groups]   |

The table above summarizes the most commonly used functions in
[pandas](){:.rlib}, which we will demonstrate in turn on data from the U.S.
Census Bureau.

### Filter and pattern matching

The `cbp` table includes character `NAICS` column. Of the 2 million
observations, lets see how many observations are left when we keep only the
2-digit NAICS codes, representing high-level sectors of the economy.

```{python lib, message = FALSE, handout = 0}

#import pandas as pd
cbp2 = cbp[cbp['NAICS'].str.contains("----")]
cbp2 = cbp2[~cbp2.NAICS.str.contains("-----")]
cbp2.head()

```

Note that a logical we used the function `contains` from pandas to filter the dataset in two steps. The function contains allows for pattern matching of any character within strings. The `~` is used to remove the rows that contains specific patterns.

===

Filtering string often uses pattern matching by [regular expressions]
which may be a bit more manageable, and streamlines the operations.

```{python message = FALSE, handout = 0}
cbp3 = cbp[cbp['NAICS'].str.contains('[0-9]{2}----')]
cbp3.head()
```

### Altering, updating and transforming columns

The `assign` function is the [pandas](){:.rlib} answer to updating or altering
your columns. It performs arbitrary operations on existing columns and appends
the result as a new column of the same length.

===

Here are two ways to create a new column using `assign` and the `[ ]` operators.

```{python, handout = 0}
cbp3["FIPS"] = cbp3["FIPSTATE"]+cbp3["FIPSCTY"]
cbp3.assign(FIPS2=lambda x: x['FIPSTATE']+x['FIPSCTY'])
cbp3.shape
cbp3.head()
```

===

### Select


To keep particular columns of a data frame (rather than filtering rows), use the `filter` or `[ ]` functions with arguments that match column names.
```{python}
cbp2.columns
```

===

One way to "match" is by including complete names, each one you want to keep:

```{python eval = TRUE}
  
cbp3 = cbp3[['FIPS','NAICS','N1_4', 'N5_9', 'N10_19']] 
cbp3.head()

```

===

Alternatively, we can use the `filter` to select all columns starting with N or matching with 'FIPS' or 'NAICS' pattern. The `filter` command is useful when chaining methods (or piping operations). 

```{python select, handout = 0}
cbp4= cbp.filter(regex='^N|FIPS|NAICS',axis=1) 
cbp4.head()
```
