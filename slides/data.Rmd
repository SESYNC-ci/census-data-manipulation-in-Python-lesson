To learn about data transformation with pandas, we need more data. The Census
Bureau collects subnational economic data for the U.S., releasing annual [County
Business Patterns (CBP)] datasets including the number of establishments,
employment, and payroll by industry. They also conduct the [American Community
Survey (ACS)] and publish, among other demographic and economic variables, estimates of
median income for individuals working in different industries.

```{python read_data, handout = 0, results = 'hide'}
import pandas as pd
cbp = pd.read_csv('data/cbp15co.csv')
cbp.describe()

```
```{python}
#str(cbp)
print(cbp.dtypes)
```

See the [CBP dataset documentation] for an explanation of the variables we don't
discuss in this lesson.

Modify the import to clean up this read: consider the data type for FIPS codes
along with what string in this CSV file represents NAs, a.k.a. data that is
not-available or missing.

```{python read_data_na, handout = 0, results = 'hide'}

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

cbp = pd.read_csv(
  'data/cbp15co.csv',
  na_values = "NULL",
  keep_default_na=False,
  dtype =  {"FIPSTATE": np.str, 
  "FIPSCTY": np.str}
  )

```

===

Question
: What changed?

Answer
: {:.fragment} Using `dtypes()` shows that the character string `""` in the CSV
file is no longer read into R as missing data (an `NA`) but as an empty string.
The two named "FIPS" columns are now correctly read as strings.

===

```{python handout = 0, results = 'hide'}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
acs =  pd.read_csv(
  'data/ACS/sector_ACS_15_5YR_S2413.csv',
  dtype = {"FIPS": np.str}
  )
```
Now let's display the data types
```{python,echo=TRUE}
#acs.dtypes
print(acs.dtypes)
```

The two datasets both contain economic variables for each U.S. county and
specified by different categories of industry. The data could potentially be
manipulated into a single table reflecting the follow statistical model.

median\_income \sim industry + establishment\_size
