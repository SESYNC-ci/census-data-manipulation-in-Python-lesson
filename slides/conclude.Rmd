## Additional Resources

The following cheat sheets and tutorials repeat much of this lesson, but also
provide information on additional functions for "data wrangling".

- [Data Wrangling Cheat Sheet]
- [Tidyverse In Pandas]
- [String and Text With Pandas]

The first is a set of cheat sheets created by pydata.org, and
provides a handy, visual summary of all the key functions discussed in this
lesson. It also lists some of the auxiliary functions that can be used within
each type of expression, e.g. aggregation functions for summarize, "moving
window" functions for mutate, etc. For those familiar with the tidyverse univers, 
please consult the second link.
